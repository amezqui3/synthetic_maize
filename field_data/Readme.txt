## Harvest&yild file
All standard_bu use 56 in calculation, but there is a plot based read time test weight.


yield_originaal_moisture (pounds/acer): based on the real moisture content in harvest
yield_dry (pounds/acer): yield convert to 0% moisture
yield_standard (pounds/acer): 15.5 moinsture 
yield_standard_bu (bu/acer): covnert from yield_standard always used in agronomic yield
yield_standardPA (g/m2) : convert from yield_standard

dry_matter/plant(kg): plot dry mattter/(stand count - greensnap)


quite note: means lodging is bad enough to make a note



## Data collection: read fiel 2019_SOP_V3.1.pdf

## Field Data
TLA= total leaf area
LAI= Leaf area index (TLA* (stand count - greensnap)/(plot area)
epd: how many GDD to growth a full expanded leaf 


## Undertaker canopy cover is only keep the central part of images
The canopy cover is calculated by pixel rate(plant:sky)

## Drone area file is calcuate the canopy cover change during the growth season
It is a real area of canopy cover
